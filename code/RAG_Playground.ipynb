    "> This notebook acts as a tool for users to play around with vectorizing documents and using a RAG architecture to improve the responses and capabilities of an AI (LLM) for some unique purpose. The goal is to allow users to run the commands to load and vectorize their own documents and test how things such as chunking and retrieval parameters can improve the responses of LLM for unique contexts and subject matter.

    ">     * **Smaller p** → the model is more conservative and predictable, focusing on the highest-confidence choices.\n",
    ">     * **Larger p** → the model allows more low-probability tokens in, increasing creativity and variety in responses.\n",

To stop the app hit the stop button on the top panel and re-run the cell below. You can also run the cell directly below this one, but it will yell at you, but you can ignore it. If restarting the app fails, you can always restart the kernel (see the restart kernel button to the right of the stop button) and re-run all the cells above to get everything going again.  "
