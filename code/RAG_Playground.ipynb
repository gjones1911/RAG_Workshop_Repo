    "> This notebook acts as a tool for users to play around with vectorizing documents and using a RAG architecture to improve the responses and capabilities of an AI (LLM) for some unique purpose. The goal is to allow users to run the commands to load and vectorize their own documents and test how things such as chunking and retrieval parameters can improve the responses of LLM for unique contexts and subject matter.

The screening, extraction, and analysis of the identified articles\\nwere performed by following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.\\nResults: Of the 15 included studies, several demonstrated the high efficacy of AI chatbots in promoting healthy lifestyles (n=6,\\n40%), smoking cessation (n=4, 27%), treatment or medication adherence (n=2, 13%), and reduction in substance misuse (n=1,\\n7%). However, there were mixed results regarding feasibility, acceptability, and usability. Selected behavior change theories and\\nexpert consultation were used to develop the behavior change strategies of AI chatbots, including goal setting, monitoring,\\nreal-time reinforcement or feedback, and on-demand support. Real-time user-chatbot interaction data, such as user preferences\\nand behavioral performance, were collected on the chatbot platform to identify ways of providing personalized services. The AI\\nchatbots demonstrated potential for scalability by deployment through accessible devices and platforms (eg, smartphones and\\nFacebook Messenger). The participants also reported that AI chatbots offered a nonjudgmental space for communicating sensitive\\ninformation.
