In- transit\\nautomated tracking and accountability tools can be used to record thelocation of the CUI Specified. Furthermore, while CUI documents andmatter being mailed must be properly labeled, the wrapping or packagecontaining the CUI must not indicate the presence of CUI. The wrappingor package should indicate \"Open by Addressee Only\" to ensure it is onlyopened by the intended recipient.\\n(5) When sending CUI via email to accounts outside of Federal IT systems theCUI must be in an attachment and protected by encryption or passwordprotection unless the authorized holder assesses that the immediatemission and business needs outweigh any risk of sending the emailwithout encryption or password protection. In such situations, authorizedholders may be required by their supervisor to provide a written statementregarding their determination. The password must be transmittedseparately from the email attachment containing CUI (e.g., by phone ortext).\\n(6) For phone transmission, encryption is not required. However, authorizedholders should consider if the sensitivity of the CUI merits encryptionwhen discussed over the phone. Additionally, CUI Specified may haveadditional encryption requirements based on a LRGWP.\\n(7) Only the approved Limited Dissemination Controls listed on the CUIRegistry may be applied to limit or specify CUI dissemination. However,authorized holders should be aware of additional dissemination controlsthat may be authorized or permitted by LRGWP [e.g., UCNI, ExportControlled Information (ECI)].\\n(8) CUI Privac y information maintained in Privacy Act systems of records\\nmay be subject to additional controls if there is information in the recordsgoverned by other CUI categories.\\n(9) The presence or marking of documents and matter containing CUI doesnot impact the re view or release of the document and matter under the\\nPrivacy Act (5 USC 552a), FOIA (5 USC 552), or MDRs under EO13526, Classified National Security Information; and 10 CFR part 1045,Nuclear Classification and Declassification .

In such situations, authorizedholders may be required by their supervisor to provide a written statementregarding their determination. The password must be transmittedseparately from the email attachment containing CUI (e.g., by phone ortext).\\n(2) Legacy documents and matter  that will retain Official Use Only (OUO)\\nmarkings or have not been reviewed to determine if they contain CUI,should also be safeguarded in accordance with the requirementsestablished in this CRD . If safeguarding requirements cannot be met, the\\nContactor must develop alternate plans for appropriately protectingdocuments and matter that may potentially contain CUI. This alternateprotection plan must be approved by the Departmental ElementDesignated CUI Official  or delegate.\\ni. Decontrol.\\n(1) Documents and matter  determined by the disseminating office to no longer\\nwarrant protection as CUI shall have their markings removed. Decontrolinstructions are not required, but if known, may be indicated on the frontof the document.\\n(2) Transferring records to NARA .\\n(a) When feasible, records containing CUI must be decontrolled priorto transferring to NARA.\\n(b) When records cannot be decontrolled before transferring toNARA, it must be indicated on a Transfer Request (TR) inNARA’s Electroni c Records Archives (ERA) or on an SF 258\\npaper transfer form, that the records should continue to becontrolled as CUI (subject to NARA’s regulation on transfer,public availability, and access: See 38 CFR parts 1235, 1250, and1256).\\n(c) For hard copy transfer, do not place a CUI marking on the outsideof the container\\n--------------\\n\\nAttachment 1  \\nPage 1-2 DOE O 471.7 \\n2-3-2022  \\ne. Safeguarding.\\n(1) CUI may be processed, stored, or transmitted on both federal information\\nsystems operated by DOE  and by a contractor on behalf of DOE . Because\\nthe confidentiality impact value for CUI is no lower than moderate inaccordance with federal Information Processing Standards Publication199, systems containing CUI must ensure proper controls are implementedaccording to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)Special Publication (SP) 800-53 in alignment with DOE Order (O) 205.1,Department of Energy Cybersecurity Program, current version.\\n(2) CUI stored on non- federal information systems must follow the\\nrequirements of NIST SP 800-171 in order to protect CUI, unless specificrequirements are specified by LRGWP for protecting the information.\\n(3) Program must establish controlled environments in which to protect CUIfrom unauthorized access or disclosure and make use of those controlledenvironments. A controlled environment is any area or space anauthorized holder deems to have adequate physical or procedural controls(e.g., barriers or managed access controls) to protect CUI fromunauthorized access or disclosure. When outside a controlled environment,ensure CUI is protected under authorized holder’s direct control, or with atleast one physical barrier, and reasonably ensure that the authorized holderor the physical barrier protects the CUI from unauthorized access orobservation.\\n(4) Program must ensure that if an unmarked document and matter is believedto contain CUI, the unmarked document and matter is protected a s CUI\\nuntil it can be reviewed to determine if it contains CUI.\\n(5) CUI that is reproduced (e.g., copied, scanned, printed, electronicallyduplicated) or shared must be protected the same as the original CUIdocument and matter in furtherance of a Lawful Government Purpose(LGP).\\n(6) When reproducing CUI on equipment such as printers, copiers, scanners,or fax machines, ensure to the extent possible the equipment does notretain the unencrypted copied data or CUI but may retain other unrelateddata, and that the eq uipment is sanitized. Consideration should be given to\\na phased implementation of eventually requiring all equipment authorizedto hold CUI to meet this requirement.\\nf. CUI Training. Contractors interacting with CUI documents and matter shall\\nreceive training  approved by the Departmental Element Designated CUI Official\\nor delegate.\\ng. Access and Shar ing. Access to documents and matter marked as containing CUI\\nor CUI from such documents and matter  are provided only to those persons who\\n--------------\\n\\n6 DOE O 471.7 \\n2-3-2022  \\n10\\n CFR part 1045 and DOE O 475.2, Identifying Clas sified Information , \\ncurrent version .  \\n(10) When determining whether to disclose information in response to a FOIA,\\nPrivacy, or MDR request, the decision must be based on the content of the\\ninformation and applicability of any FOIA or Privacy equivalencies andexemptions, regardless of whether an agency designates or marks theinformation as CUI.\\n(11) All documents and matter must be reviewed to ensure they do not contain\\nCUI prior to public release. CUI must be removed or decontrolled fromdocuments prior to public release.\\n(12) When intending to share CUI with a non- executive branch entity, there\\nshould be a formal agreement whenever feasible. At a minimum, theagreement must include provisions that state:\\n(a) Non-executive branch entities must handle CUI in accordanc e with\\nEO 13556, 32 CFR part 2002, this Directive, and the CUI Registry;\\n(b) Misuse of CUI is subject to penalties established in applicable\\nLRGWP; and\\n(c) The non-executive branch entity must report any non- compliance\\nwith handling requirements to the disseminating office usingmethods approved by the SAO for CUI.\\n(13) When an agency cannot enter into agreement but is required to\\ndisseminate CUI to non-executive branch entities, it must becommunicated to the recipient that the Government strongly encouragesthe non- executive branch entity to protect CUI in accordance with EO\\n13556, 32 CFR part 2002, this Directive, and the CUI Registry, and thatsuch protections should accompany the CUI if the entity disseminates itfurther.\\n(14) A waiver providing equivalencies and exemptions on encryption can be\\nrequested from the Departmental Element’s Designated CUI Official.When CUI is reproduced (e.g., copy, scan, print, electronically duplicate)or shared in furtherance of an LGP, it must be marked and protected in thesame way as th e original CUI document.\\n(15) When reproducing CUI on equipment such as printers, copiers, scanners,\\nor fax machines, ensure to the extent possible the equipment does notretain the copied data or CUI but may retain other unrelated data, and thatthe equipment is sanitized in accordance with NIST (SP) 800 -53 and NIST\\nSP 800-88.
